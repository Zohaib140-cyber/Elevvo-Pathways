📌 Task Highlights
Task 1 – Data Analysis & Visualization

🔗 View in nbviewer
 | Run in Colab

Objective:

Clean raw datasets and prepare them for analysis

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Create insightful visualizations to uncover trends and patterns

Summarize findings in a structured, data-driven way

Outcome:
✔️ Solid foundation in preprocessing and wrangling data
✔️ Ability to uncover hidden insights through visuals
✔️ Established workflow for structured problem-solving

Task 2 – Advanced Analysis with Polished Workflow

🔗 View in nbviewer
 | Run in Colab

Objective:

Perform detailed analysis with professional formatting

Integrate multiple types of visualizations (bar plots, heatmaps, scatter plots)

Enhance notebook readability with clear markdown explanations

Communicate insights effectively by blending code + visuals

Outcome:
✔️ Elevated storytelling through data
✔️ Professional-quality notebook formatting
✔️ Deeper analytical reasoning

Task 7 – Time Series Sales Analysis

🔗 View in nbviewer
 | Run in Colab

Objective:

Analyze multi-year retail sales data (2015–2022)

Identify overall trends and seasonal patterns

Use moving averages to smooth fluctuations

Decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals

Forecast future sales using Holt-Winters / exponential smoothing

Outcome:
✔️ Practical exposure to time series methods
✔️ Forecasting skills applicable to real-world retail/business contexts
✔️ End-to-end analysis workflow: from raw data to prediction
✔️ Stronger ability to connect statistical outputs with business decisions
